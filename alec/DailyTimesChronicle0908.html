<P>BURLINGTON — Tragedy struck the Boulder Drive family of a 
two-and-a-half-year-old boy Tuesday afternoon, when his parents learned he 
choked on some food and died, officials and the family stated.
<P>Alec Ross, who according to a family member was in the care of a babysitter 
who watches him regularly, was pronounced dead at the Lahey Clinic around 12:15 
p.m., according to police and fire officials.
<P>Alec was the son of Gordon and Julia Ross of Boulder Drive. The couple has 
another son, Liam, age one-and-a-half.
<P>Police and fire units responded to a second Boulder Drive location, the home 
of Francis and Antonietta Costanzo, where the child was being baby-sat, sources 
indicated. This was not a licensed day-care center, according to sources, it was 
a personal sitter for the child.
<P>"This is devastating, obviously, for the family," said Alec's aunt, Anne 
Ross-Raymond, in a telephone interview with the Daily Times Chronicle this 
morning. "The family is obviously in very deep grief."
<P>Ross-Raymond said that Alec choked on string cheese.
<P>The call came into the Fire Department at 11:46 a.m., Tuesday, according to 
Chief Lee Callahan, and by 12:11 p.m., the ambulance was at the hospital, but it 
was too late. 
<P>After emergency medical technicians did some work on the child at the house, 
it took about nine minutes to get to Lahey, Callahan said.
<P>"This was just a very tragic accident," Callahan said.
<P>Ross-Raymond said that Alec "was not under his parents' care at the time" and 
that when the "caretaker noticed he was choking, she tried to dislodge the food 
with the Heimlich Maneuver, but was unsuccessful."
<P>She added that Alec's father rode in the ambulance with him to Lahey Clinic.
<P>Burlington Police Lt. William Faria, working on the death locally with Sgt. 
Gregory Skehan, said this morning that an autopsy was expected to be performed 
on Alec today.
<P>"But the state medical examiner's office and State Police have pretty much 
ruled it accidental," Faria stated.
<P>Callahan said that because of the tragic nature of the incident, a Fire 
Department Critical Incident Stress Management Team was called into Burlington 
from Boston Tuesday, and stayed for about one-and-one-half hours.
<P>"We would like to get this message out, warn parents of the dangers of this 
food which is string cheese," said Ross-Raymond. "Parents should try to avoid 
this food for their children.
<P>"It is a block-shaped food (cylindrical, in individually-wrapped packages), 
and it can become lodged in a child's throat very easily," Ross-Raymond stated.
<P>"And when it becomes lodged," Ross-Raymond continued, "there is very little 
time to react. There is very little you can do what it happens. We would like 
parents to know this."
