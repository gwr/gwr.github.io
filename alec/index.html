<h2>
Remembering Alec Steven Ross</h2>

<p>
<img align="left" src="pictures/images/PICT0028c.jpg">
Alec Steven Ross was our dear little boy - our first born.
He was born the 14th of February, 2002, and died much too
soon on the 7th of September, 2004.

<p>
Many people ask how he died.  He choked on a cheese stick.
He was at the home of someone who sometimes used to watch
our boys for us.  As much as she tried, she was never
able to clear his airway.  And the sad truth is, with
choking accidents and kids, you don't have very long.
A few minutes maybe, but not enough time to wait for
the EMTs to arrive.  A terrible tragedy.

<p>
Here's a
<a href=DailyTimesChronicle0908.html>
newspaper article</a> about the accident, and the
<a href="OBITUARY.Alec.htm">obituary</a>.

But rather than how he died, let's remember how he lived!

<p>
Alec was a joyful, loving, and kind little boy, who
loved his little brother, Liam; loved to play in the
water; loved to dance naked.  Loved music, especially Raffi.

<p>
Here are some more <a href="pictures/index.html">pictures of Alec</a>
collected by friends who knew him.  A celebration of Alec's time with us.

<p>
We also had people write down favorite memories of Alec
and give them to us.  After enough time had passed so we
could look at those without completely falling apart, we
assembled those and some favorite pictures into a scrap
book we call "Alec's Memory Book".  The idea to do this
was suggested by a friend not long after Alec died, and
we're very gateful for the suggestion.  We like to take
out Alec's Memory Book on his birthday and spend some
quiet time remembering our sweet little Valentine's day boy.
